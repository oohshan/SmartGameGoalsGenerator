# Smart Game Goals Generator

Introduction and Goals

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard for Ludis Analytics that takes the statistics of the UK basketball (or other) team and an opponent and analyzes them to produce specific goals in different statistical categories for an upcoming matchup. These would be actionable goals, with defensible and interpretable numbers to support the goals (specifically, how the goals relate to winning percentage). The coach should be able to choose Key Metrics for the game (rebounding, turnovers) and once they have chosen the stats they want to set goals for, the application should be able to give recommendations for that goal based on the opponent and their lineup.

NCAA men's basketball teams use very few advanced data analytics techniques to prepare for their games. Teams currently rely on video review and other basic methods to determine how they will approach their opponents. There is a clear opening in the market for a platform that offers teams the access to data that will give them a competitive advantage over their opponents. Our Smart Goal Game Generator dashboard will be one of many solutions offered to the teams using Ludis Analytics.  


Top three quality goals

* Accessible to users of all technological backgrounds
* Clear separation of front-end and back-end code
* Clearly documented, modular so that new features/functionality can be added in the future
